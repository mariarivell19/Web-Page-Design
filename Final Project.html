    	    		<p class="p1" ><b>Dr. Shirley Ann Jackson </b> is a theoretical physicist and black inventor 
    	    	has made many advances in science. As a child she first developed an interest 
    	    	in science and math and conducted several experiments and studies. She attended
    	    	Roosevelt High School and graduated as valedictorian in 1964. She later went on to
    	    	study at MIT. As a student she tutored students at the Roxbury YMCA and volunteered 
    	    	at the Boston City Hospital. Although she was accepted into Brown, Harvard, and 
    	    	the University of Chicago, Dr. Jackson chose to stay at MIT for her doctoral work. </p> 
    	    	
    	    		<p class="p1" >She has a Ph.D. in Theoretical Elementary Particle Physics and an S.B. in Physics.
    	    	In the 1970s, she studied and conducted research at physics laboratories in Europe 
    	    	and in the United States. Her first official job was as a research associate at the
    	    	<b>Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.</b> There she studied hadrons which are subatomic 
    	    	particles that inclue baryons and mesons. In 1976, Dr. Jackson joined the <b>Theoretical 
    	    	Physics Research Departments at AT & T Bell Laboratories.</b> There she examined the properties
    	    	various materials in an effort to discover useful applications. She also explored 
    	    	theories of charge density waves and the reactions of neutrinos. </p>
    	    	
    	    		<p class="p1" > Dr. Jackson has led a world-class technological research at <b> Rensselaer Polytechnic
    	    	Institute of Troy, New York, and Hartford, Connecticut.</b> She has a vision to remake the university and 
    	    	it was known as The Rensselaer Plan. The transformation included a Center for 
    	    	Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies, the Curtis R. Priem Experimental 
    	    	Media and Performing Arts Center, and the Center for Computational Innovations. </p>
