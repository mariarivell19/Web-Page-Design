<! - - Here is an explanation of why guests should come to visit the penitentiary. - - >
	<h3> Why Should You Come? </h3>
		<blockquote><b>THE TERROR BEGINS!</b> The West Virginia State Penitentiary that once inhibited inmates has been turned into a haunted museum for family and friends to visit. (It is recommended for children above the age of 13.) For the past 22 years, it has been scaring its visitors with amazing props, digital FX, great actors, extraordinary professional makeup, and tourguides who were once prison guards. With authentic letters,  handmade prisoner weapons such a knives and shivs, and the prison cells will give you a truly shocking and breathtaking experience. You will feel the chilling presence of past prisoners as you pass through the halls of the penitentiary. </blockquote>

<! - - This is a set of unordered lists talking about activities the penitentiary offers; such as multiple types of tours and escape rooms. - - >
	<h3>What Do We Offer? </h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b> Escape the Pen: The Execution </b></li>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Rules:</b> Escape rooms are a type of physical adventure game in which people are locked in a themed room with other participants. They have to use the different elements within the room to solve a series of puzzles, find clues, and escape the room within a set time limit. (60 minutes) Participants must be observant and use their critical/lateral thinking skills to escape the room. </li>
					<li> The Governor of West Virginia has ordered a one hour stay of execution for an inmate at the West Virginia State Penitentiary. Inmate Lefty Lafferty was scheduled to be put to death today, but in a bizarre turn of events the Governor halted the electric chair execution due to new information that was received just hours ago. Details are not available, but a source close to the administration has said that a special investigative team is being dispatched to the Penitentiary. The Governor received an anonymous tip, rumored to have been sent via fax that listed details about the crime Lefty is being charged with; our source indicated that there are details included that no one could have known. After brief consideration the execution has been halted for one hour. </li>

	<h3> Ratings and Reviews: </h3>
		<blockquote> User "kilgorerena" says: <b> Scary and fun! </b> Make sure you take the last tour of the day. The guide is amazing and allows you to wander at will and even places that are dark and creepy! Knowledgable because he actually worked there when it was open and loves to tell you about the "gate." Want to know more? You will need to go yourself, we won't let that cat out of the bad LOL! Ask questions, be sure to check out the books for sale, we bought one and wished we purchased a couple more. </blockquote>
		<blockquote> User "John P" says: <b> AWESOME!!! </b> We did the Dungeons of Horro one. It was SUPER fun! The actors were great, the animatronic things were super cool, the vibe was amazing, etc. We've been to a TON of these things and this was by far the best one we've been to and we will definitely be back again next year, but we will also be looking into the historical tours and ghost tours and everything too! The only negative thing I can say is they told us the tour would be 45 minutes, but it was twice that. Probably because my girlfriend and I kept trolling the actors which made it take too long, so for most people 45 minutes sounds about right! </blockquote>
		<blockquote> User "brickie074" says: <b> Amazing History </b> Truly a hidden gem, and off the touristy path but worth the trip. Not a place for young children - should be at least 13. It is  a massively huge place. Just to see all the fencing wire, cages, razor wire and the cells is an experience you will not soon forget. Seeing all the weapons - knives, shivs, etc, that the prisoners made is an eye opener. Do not pass up reading the letter from Charles Manson. Our tour guide was a former guard at the prison and she was very good, she answered all of questions etc, and had many interesting "tales" to share. This place is worth a side trip. </blockquote>
